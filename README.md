Minefield is a Java-based simulation game. It models agents navigating a field filled with hidden mines, testing decision-making and movement strategies within a simulated environment.

Features:
Agent-based simulation where entities navigate a minefield.
Randomized mine placement for varied outcomes each run.
Configurable parameters such as field size, agent count, and mine density.
Extendable framework for adding new behaviors or rules.
Visualization using the SimStation framework to observe agent movement and survival.
